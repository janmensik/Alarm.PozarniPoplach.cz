## 2024-05-18 - [Fix XSS Vulnerabilities in Activation Page]
**Vulnerability:** User inputs and variables like `{$error}`, `{$device_code}`, and `{$session_data.device_uuid}` were not escaped before being rendered in `tpl/page.activate.html`.
**Learning:** Smarty templates in this project do not automatically escape output. If not explicitly escaped, any unvalidated or untrusted user data rendered to the page can result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Prevention:** Always use the `|escape` filter (e.g., `{$variable|escape}`) when outputting user-provided data in Smarty templates.

## 2024-05-25 - [Missing Secure Session Cookie Parameters]
**Vulnerability:** `session_start()` was called without explicitly configuring secure cookie parameters (`httponly`, `samesite`, `secure`).
**Learning:** By default, PHP sessions might not have `httponly` or `samesite` set, making them vulnerable to XSS (session hijacking) and CSRF.
**Prevention:** Always configure session cookie parameters securely via `session_set_cookie_params()` before calling `session_start()`. Ensure `httponly` is true, and `samesite` is set appropriately (e.g., `Lax` or `Strict`).

## 2026-05-28 - [Prevent XXE in Dispatch parser]
**Vulnerability:** The HTML parser (`DOMDocument::loadHTML()`) was used to parse external dispatch emails without disabling external network access, leaving it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
**Learning:** `DOMDocument` in PHP can be vulnerable to XXE if untrusted content is loaded without explicit flags that disable network access. Note that `LIBXML_NOENT` actually *enables* entity expansion in libxml, which causes XXE vulnerabilities instead of preventing them. It stands for "Substitute Entities". Only `LIBXML_NONET` should be used.
**Prevention:** Always pass the `LIBXML_NONET` flag when using `loadHTML` or `loadXML` on untrusted input to disable external DTDs and network requests. Never use `LIBXML_NOENT` for security purposes as it enables entity expansion.

## 2026-06-08 - [Fix Potential IMAP Credential Leak in Cron]
**Vulnerability:** The `cron.email_import.php` script used `die($ex->getMessage())` to handle IMAP connection failures.
**Learning:** Using `die()` or `echo` for errors in CLI scripts prints directly to stdout. In cron environments, these outputs are often captured by hosting providers and sent via email or logged in plain text unmasked, which can leak sensitive data like IMAP credentials present in the exception message.
**Prevention:** Use `error_log()` combined with `exit(1)` for fatal errors in CLI scripts to ensure errors are written to the configured PHP error log (which is usually secured) rather than stdout.
